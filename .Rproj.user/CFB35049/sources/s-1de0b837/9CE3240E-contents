# CovidReportECDC
This R package can visualize covid data from 'European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control'.

The package contains three functions:
 
 - get_and_process_covid_data(): download the data from ECDC, and filter the data on country, year and month. 
 - visualize_covid_data(data): which can be used to visiualize a dataframe with covid data from get_and_process_covid_data().
 - plot_covid(): combines the previous two functions to directly make a plot from the arguments.
 
I will show how to work with every function in this Rmd.

Let's start with get_and_process_covid_data(), this functions needs the following arguments ("Country", year, months).
```{r}
coviddata_nl_2022_JanFebMar <-get_and_process_covid_data(country = "Netherlands", 2022, c(1,2,3) )  

coviddata_nl_2022_JanFebMar %>% head()
```
Now you have a dataframe with the covid data in the Netherlands in the year 2022 from the months january, febuary and march.

We can plot this data easly with the visualize_covid_data() function, this function needs only one argument and that is a dataframe from the get_and_process_covid_data() function

```{r}
visualize_covid_data(coviddata_nl_2022_JanFebMar)
```

This creates two plots, one for the covid cases and one for the covid related deaths.

The last function plot_covid() combines the other two functions and needs the following arguments aswell ("Country", year, months).

```{r}

plot_covid(country = "Germany", 2022, c(6:10))

```

This immediately creates two plots.
